# Roanbot
Code for the Skype bot "Roanbot" created by Roandask. Roanbot dynamically loads all .dll files in the Modules folder. The only required files are: Skype4COM.dll, Roanbot.exe, ModuleBase.dll, and BasicCommands.dll. All except the last one should be located in the same folder, with BasicCommands being located in the Modules folder (subject to change in future versions, since it really shouldn't be).
